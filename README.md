## Project Background
Analyzing crime data has many uses such as deciding where to rent or buy a home, determining how to allocate resources to the community as well as determining how changes in laws and policies impact crime. Our goal was to create a St. Paul Crime Data Dashboard using Crime Data available at (https://information.stpaul.gov/datasets/stpaul::crime-incident-report/about)

Using our dashboard we hope to answer the following questions: 
1- How has crime changed in St. Paul year to year?
2- Are there times of the year when certain crimes might be more prevalent in St. Paul?
3- How do crimes change based on the neighborhood?
